(Matthew 13:44). This parable is often used to explain how one should find salvation, and buy it. May be we could see it from another angle. The kingdom is like a treasure hid in a field. Individually and corporately, we are that earthen field. The kingdom is in us, but hidden, veiled by the flesh. Jesus found it, and “for the joy that was set before him, endured the cross” and He bought that field. He paid the price in full. He purchased our earthen vessels. He also has an eternal plan for us. “For ye are bought with a price; therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit, which are God’s” (I கொரி 6:20). Our body has been purchased; so also our spirit. What is He going to do with this earthen body of ours? The Word of God says, “who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body...” (Philippians 3:21). Praise His wonderful name! He will take this very earthly tabernacle we now live in, and change it into a glorious and eternal temple. “We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed” (I கொரி 15:51).",

When man takes the Word of God and reads it and says, “The Word of God says, this but I say this!” then he is on the way of establishing a tradition. The scribes were breaking the commandment of God by giving themselves to the tradition of man. They did not realise that by keeping the tradition of man they were breaking and transgressing and disobeying God’s commandments. Jesus emphasises that by adhering to their traditions, the scribes had made the commandments of God to be null and void. Jesus said that they invalidated the Word of God for the sake of their traditions. If you are a true disciple of Jesus you will also be ready to break any tradition today. One of the greatest enemies of God’s purposes in these days is the “traditions of men”. But the Scripture says, “You shall know the truth (ie. you shall know Him; you shall know the Word) and the truth shall set you f ree, indeed”.",

Although He was a Son, He learned (active, special) obedience through what He suffered and (His completed experience) making Him perfect (equipped), He became the Author and Source of eternal salvation to all those who give heed and obey Him,” (Hebrews 5:7-9, Amplified). The Lord Jesus had reverence for the will of God. We need to learn true obedience to the will of God. It is one of the most important ingredients in the life of His sons today. We must trust the Father and submit to His perfect will. The Greek word ‘PASCHO’ is used here to denote ‘suffering’. This word does not refer to His suffering on the cross.

The word ‘lasciviousness’ means lacking moral discipline, or having no regard for acceptable moral standards. The English word comes from a Latin word ‘lesvia’ which means loose; runaway passion; lust. It signifies lawlessness and the casting away of restraint. It represents all that is filthy and degraded. Jude proclaims that in the last days, men will come into the church of Christ and turn the grace of God into lasciviousness. How terrible! They will turn the grace of God and manipulate it until it allows one to live in all kinds of lawlessness, immorality and filth. Jude says that what is required of us, therefore, is to contend and fight hard to maintain and live in this grace that God has given to us. Jesus called the sin of lasciviousness the sin of the heart. Jude says they will take God’s grace and suddenly twist it. They will manipulate the truth so that it produces immorality in God’s people. False things are not going to enter into the church from outside the church; they will enter the church from within, through the integral ministries operating in the church.",

Thus our salvation has a much higher, purpose, beloved. We are often guilty of limiting our salvation to a few things. If you read the writings of Paul carefully, you will realise that his burden for unbelievers was that they might be saved from sin.

The Scriptures make it very clear that the grace of God does two things in the life of every believer. Firstly, it produces anticipation for the coming of the Lord. Secondly, it inculcates a godly fear and a holy reverence for the Lord. These two inward aspects work co-jointly and inseparably in God’s people. We cannot possess one without the other. It cannot be that we anticipate His coming eagerly, but at the same time, continue to live without godly fear and reverence. It is impossible for us to possess one without the other if the grace of God is upon us. But what we see today is that while everyone is waiting for the coming of the Lord Jesus, their lives and their hearts do not exhibit godly fear and reverence. This is nothing short of turning the grace of God into immorality because of the deception of the evil one. In other words, the grace of God produces reverence and godly fear. Reverence includes awe, respect, and soberness.",

		"devotion": "In the days of Moses, twelve people — one from each tribe — were chosen to go into the land of Canaan. They were to spy the land and bring back a report to the people of God. We know that when the twelve returned, they presented two kinds of intelligence reports. One report said that they would never be able to inherit the land of Canaan because giants occupied the land, before which they were like grasshoppers. The other report said that they were well able to take the land at once. We know that it was this good, positive report of Caleb and Joshua that helped the new generation of Israel to enter into the land later on. When the people heard the report of Joshua and Caleb, they were ready to stone them. This reveals a significant fact. The enemy was not only out there in the land of Canaan, but there was an enemy entrenched in the hearts of God’s people as well. The Israelites had not only to overthrow their enemies in the land of Canaan, but there was a formidable enemy within the Israelite camp also. This enemy had a firm foothold in the hearts of the people of God. Unobtrusively, the enemy had made a way into their very hearts! How true that is to principle and to history!",

Look at the way you behave in my house; look at your worship; look at your attitude; look at your mentality; look at your lifestyle; look how you behave yourself in My house.” And then He adds, “Go and do the same with your earthly boss, and see what he would do and say to you.” Truly, if we were to misbehave and deal with our earthly bosses as we do with the Lord, we would loose our jobs in the twinkling of an eye. The church would be flooded with prayer requests of those who would have lost their jobs! If we continue to behave in a similar manner towards our Lord, what do we expect the Lord to do? Saints, the question is not how much we worship or serve the Lord, but what is the quality of our worship and service unto the Lord. The Word in Malachi shows that there was no shortage of sacrifices (or meetings) or worship in the house of God in those days but quality was wanting.",

What did the law require of God’s people in days past? Only to fear the Lord, love Him, walk in His ways and serve Him! It is the same even today! To fear the Lord, our God, and to love Him, and to walk in His ways, and to serve the Lord our God with all our heart, with all our soul, and with all our being, is the consistent, inflexible and unfailing desire of God for each one of us. “Now therefore fear the LORD, and serve him in sincerity and in truth: and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the flood, and in Egypt; and serve ye the LORD.” ( Joshua 24:14). Many believers do not understand that the love of God can never be separated from the reverential fear and respect of God. The fear of God and the love of God are two sides of the same coin. God will be pleased with our lives only if fear and love for Him are not separated from each another.",

We know this because He made man in His own image and His likeness. He loves man and He wants man to know the love of God. At the same time, God wants man to fear Him in a reverential, godly way. To fear God does not mean that we become fearful of Him; the right fear of God will bring a desire to obey Him spontaneously. The incorrect kind of fear of God will bring us to obey God in a certain way, it will lead us to a certain kind of obedience, but not to the obedience of faith where love for God is the driving motive. Serving God with a heart that fears Him but does not also love Him, will result in dead works, without a life-fellowship with the Father, the Son and with one another. Abraham did not obey the Lord because he feared that some terrible evil would befall him unless he obeyed God. He obeyed the Lord because of an inherent and integral love for God. The obedience of faith leads us to love the Lord uncondionally. Abraham loved the Lord not because he feared the judgments of the Lord or the punishments that the Lord could mete out to Him, but because a love for the Lord was working in him.",

Jesus’ union with the Father, and His intimacy with the Holy Spirit of God, was something deep and real. His relationship with the Father was not superficial, theoretical, or judicial. It was something so real, so deep and so unshakeable. It could sustain Him in every trial, test and affliction. In spite of all the efforts of men, demons, the powers of hell, and the devil himself, to separate Jesus from the Father, Jesus kept a close and intimate fellowship with His Father. His union with the Father remained unshakeable. It was not anything superficial; it was something tried, tested and proven. Jesus was sensitive to the Father’s desires at all times. His union with the Father remained uninterrupted throughout His life. The Lord made it very clear that the union that existed between Him and the Father could also exist between the Father, Christ and us. We can experience the same organic oneness, reality and fellowship that He went through. This is the kind of relationship and fellowship we ought to have with the Father. Wherever we go and whatever we do, we need to remain in the place of union with God.",

This seeking for glory is seen as something that started very early in the scripture and we see it going all the way through; but the glory of man always ended in corruption! We are living in a world where man is trying to obtain glory for himself. The pronouncement of God on the life of man that brings a glory of his own, is one of corruption. This corruption of man which seeks his own glory is a self-destroying thing. It will result in obliterating man from the face of this earth. On one hand, man is trying to invent devices to destroy other men, but on the other, man is clothing himself with a self-made glory, that will result in his own destruction. Men use self-proclaimed designations, grand titles and high-sounding words to glorify themselves. People elevate themselves with the honour that comes from others. Their glory lies in the honour that others give them because of their elaborate titles and terminology. Man honours himself for inventing things — inventions that will, one day, blot out the very human race! Is that something glorious? It seems that man cannot help himself because he is energised by another power and is no more his own master. He is ruled by another spirit.

The glory which our Lord once rejected with cold scorn is now being admired and sought after by multitudes who make a loud profession of accepting the gospel. The old trick which our Lord saw through so easily is charming His present day followers into smiling acquiescence. The devil did not know Christ, but apparently he knows Christians. Satan’s effort to destroy Christianity on the doctrinal front has not been a success; there are probably more Bible believers now than at any time in world history. Still the true religion of the cross is in great and serious peril on another front and strangely enough, many of the very warriors who fought so valiantly when the veracity of the Bible was attacked have failed to recognize the enemy when he has approached from a new direction. The real peril today arises from within the fold of orthodox believers. It consists of an acceptance of the world’s values, a belief that the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them are valid prizes to be pursued by believing men and women. Blind leaders of blind souls are admitting that there is something to be said in favor of the world-glory after all; they insist that Christians should not cut themselves off from the pleasures of the world, except, of course, from those that are too degraded for respectable society.” -AWT",

In the OldTestament, the last day of the Feast of Tabernacles was called the day of the solemn assembly. On that day the people put aside everything else, and gave themselves wholly to worship the Father. There is more light on the solemn assembly in Isaiah. “To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me? saith the LORD: I am full of the burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he goats.When ye come to appear before me, who hath required this at your hand, to tread my courts? Bring no more vain oblations; incense is an abomination unto me; the new moons and sabbaths, the calling of assemblies, I cannot away with; it is iniquity, even the solemn meeting.” (Isaiah 1:11-13) Even on the last day of the feast when the people had separated themselves for focused worship, the Lord was not pleased. However in Zephaniah, the Lord says that He will gather those who are sorrowful for the solemn assembly. The solemn assembly talked about a people who were separated unto God. The feast was a time to meet with the Lord. This is true for the Church as well, for the Church is a solemn assembly. The Church is the gathering of separated people.",
